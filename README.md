# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer data using the UCI Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on several features of the tumor cells.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: UCI Breast Cancer dataset containing features like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and more.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Perceptron
- **Key Tasks**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
  - **Model Training**: Training different machine learning models on the training dataset.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - **Model Comparison**: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective algorithm.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset.
- Preprocessing steps to handle missing values and standardize the data.
- Implementation of various classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Perceptron).
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model accuracy.
- Model comparison to determine the best performing algorithm for the dataset.
