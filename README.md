# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer data using the UCI Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on several features of the tumor cells.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: UCI Breast Cancer dataset containing features like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and more.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Perceptron
- **Key Tasks**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
  - **Model Training**: Training different machine learning models on the training dataset.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - **Model Comparison**: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective algorithm.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset.
- Preprocessing steps to handle missing values and standardize the data.
- Implementation of various classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Perceptron).
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model accuracy.
- Model comparison to determine the best performing algorithm for the dataset.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to explore the dataset, train models, and evaluate performance:
Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook BreastCancerClassification.ipynb
Python script:
bash
Copy code
python classify_breast_cancer.py
Example
To run the models and see results, you can use the BreastCancerClassification.ipynb notebook. It will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and display evaluation metrics.

### Key Points:

- Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username in the clone URL.
- Add the appropriate script filenames (`BreastCancerClassification.ipynb` or `classify_breast_cancer.py`) based on your actual file names.
- You can expand on the "Example" section if needed, for instance, by providing more specific instructions or example outputs.
